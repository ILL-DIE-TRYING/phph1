# phph1
PHPH1 is a PHP class that bridges the Harmony ONE Node API to PHP. The goal is to implement every Node API and make it simple for a dev to input the data and retrieve the results in an easy to use data array.

File is uploaded. I will put up an example use.

Currently this is unoptimized and unfinished. Once it is finished I will break down its use here.

WARNING! There is no validation for most input yet so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! THIS IS UNFINISHED WORK!

DANGER WILL ROBINSON!

All calls have been tested except raw sends.

There is much to do. If you would like to help out with some PHP skills feel free to contribute.

Have fun!
